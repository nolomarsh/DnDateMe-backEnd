# DnDateMe
DnDateMe is a dating App were users are able to meet and play in groups with fellow DnD fans.

### Technologies Used
This project uses the MERN stack(Mongo, Express, React, Node), and consists of two applications: a front-end built on React and a back-end API built on Express.js. The API involves three collections stored on MongoDB Atlas, based on three loosely related models and controllers. Both applications are hosted on Heroku (links included at the end of this README).

### Approach Taken
We used Trello to record and keep track of tasks and ensure our projected timeline was met. we distributed responsibilities between back-end and front-end to start to avoid any branch conflicts. As we completed the back-end work we continued to use a feature-based approach distributed between contributors to avoid potential merge conflicts.

### Unsolved Problems
We attempted incorporating session and cookie data for user login. Unfortunately, we were unable to get a working model but will continue to explore options to include it in a later release. We also want to revisit integrating Socket.io for further chat functionality and other development tools.
